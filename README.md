# Telus Industry Project

## Problem
How might we help users to create a TV package that has all their preferred channels?

## Solution
We created a search feature that lets users choose their package based on which channels have the shows or movies they want to watch this month.

We envisioned a user who knows what they want to watch but doesn't know where to find it. The shows and movies they like are spread across streaming services, and things are always changing.

One day they log in to find that the show they wanted to see is gone, and then discover a different channel has it now. It's impossible to keep up: they can't change services every month, and they don't want the cost of subscribing to everything at the same time.

Our solution empowers the user to get the most out of their ability to change the channels in their Telus Optik package each month. Users can watch what they want this month, and change channels next month to watch the next show on their list.
